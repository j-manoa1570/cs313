                    Admin 4:51:29PM: This is where the conversation text will appear. I think one problem I will run into is that this should actually be a text file but for now it is just stuff in the database.

                <p>
                    Admin 4:52:09PM: Hopefully I will also figure out how to display the text similar to this but better.
