After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
	https://glacial-chamber-18323.herokuapp.com/prove02/home.html

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
	https://github.com/j-manoa1570/cs313.git

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
	All functions that are required for the assignment work. There are drop downs across the top and the ones that work are Profile -> Homepage, Assignments -> Homepage, and DJ/Lighting -> DJAndX. I have not linked/uploaded content to the other pages yet.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
	All requirements for the assignment are working.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
	A lot of it was review and much needed review as it has been about a year since I last did any web work.

6. What is the difference between an HTTP Get and Post? When should each be used?
	GET sends field form data  and is less secure as all data that is sent is placed into the URL, is cached, remains in history, and can be bookmarked while POST sends the entire form, is not cached, and is not in history, and cannot be bookmarked. When developing using POST, should alert user that information is to be resubmitted.
	Post should be used for sending confidential information such as passwords.
	Get should be used when retrieving data.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
[ ] A - Some attempt was made
[ ] B - Developing, but significantly deficient
[ ] C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
[X] D - Meets requirements
[ ] E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
	It meets all of the requirements. The additional page that is linked, I am not sure that would really be considered as going above and beyond.
