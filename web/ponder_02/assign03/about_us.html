                    <h3>Chris Payne</h3>
                    Chris grew up in, on, and around the mountains of northern Utah where he learned
                    of the beauties of nature first hand at a young age. He made his first hammock,
                    when he was about nine years old, out of an old bed sheet and some spare rope he
                    found in his parents garage. Growing up he could often be found in nature, whether
                    climbing the big tree in his backyard to do his homework in middle school, or
                    hiking just to clear his head. He was also he original hammocker in the Rexburg
                    Hammocks group.

                    <h3>Jonathan Manoa</h3>
                    Jonathan hails from Santa Maria, California. Most of his childhood was spent playing
                    outside. He enjoyed the great outdoors all through high school with camping trips,
                    ckayaking, and hiking, Hammocks didn't come into his life until his third semester of
                    college when his roommate Chris texted him over the break about getting a hammock.
                    This is when he finally decided to make the jump(almost literally) into hammocks.
                    Since then, hammocks have been his favorite past time.
